Added a toolbar menu to access a payment section that works with donations. <br>

<br>

Pressing any of the buttons will take you to a SumUp Payment screen and a receipt option will be available. <br>

# Coder Notes
This was a equally difficult and fun test. 

For the donation screen I replicated the Activity-Fragment configurations. Both classes are under the donation package.
The Payment was handled in the SumUpPaymentActivity class under the SumUp package.
The SumUpAPI and the data structures under the dataModel are the Retrofit Classes.

Originally I wanted to have every to-do editable for 1â‚¬ or have the alarm functionality behind a paywall on top of the donation section. Due to time constraints and code complexity these changes will have to wait until the next revision.

# Bugs

On some configurations, the main screen won't dynamically adapt to new items being added. If the app is restarted, they will show correctly. 

Other issues might arise when connectivity is not optimal.

# Important

Android Plugin Version must remain 2.3.0. 
Updating Gradle might incur in unknown errors.
